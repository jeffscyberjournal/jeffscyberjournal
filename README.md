## Objective

As part of my journey through cybersecurity, this repository serves as a space to showcase recent experiences, technologies I've worked with, and general IT and security-related projects I've explored. Each entry reflects the context and considerations that were important to me at the timeâ€”whether it was deepening technical understanding, experimenting with new tools, or tackling challenges that shaped my learning. This collection is both a personal archive and a practical demonstration of growth through hands-on engagement.

### Experiences from working with organisations
- Application vulnerability assessment project working with SlaveCheck Foundation Pty Ltd (Sydney).
- Infrastructure vulnerability assessment project working with My1health (Kenya).
- Governance Risk and Compliance assessment project working with Courtroom5 (North Carolina).
- Incident Response planning project based for Courtroom5.
- Internship Logitrain - a fast paced structured learning experience opening my eye more to IT administation type roles than    the cybersecurity internship that was stated (I am sorry but stating Cybersecurity on internship does not make it cybersecurity related).
