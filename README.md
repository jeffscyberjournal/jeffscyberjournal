Technically skilled and forensic-minded, I'm an IT and cybersecurity professional driven to tackle complex challenges across system administration, threat detection, and exploit analysis.


## Objective

As part of my journey through cybersecurity, this repository serves as a space to showcase recent experiences, technologies I've worked with, and general IT and security-related projects I've explored. Each entry reflects the context and considerations that were important to me at the timeâ€”whether it was deepening technical understanding, experimenting with new tools, or tackling challenges that shaped my learning. This collection is both a personal archive and a practical demonstration of growth through hands-on engagement.
