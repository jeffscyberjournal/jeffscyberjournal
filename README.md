Technically skilled and forensic-minded, I'm an IT and cybersecurity professional driven to tackle complex challenges across system administration, threat detection, and exploit analysis.


## Objective

As part of my journey through cybersecurity, this repository serves as a space to showcase recent experiences, technologies I've worked with, and general IT and security-related projects I've explored. Each entry reflects the context and considerations that were important to me at the time—whether it was deepening technical understanding, experimenting with new tools, or tackling challenges that shaped my learning. This collection is both a personal archive and a practical demonstration of growth through hands-on engagement.

### Relevant projects / work experience:
   - **Harness Projects Live Company Projects (2024–2025)**  
  Completed cybersecurity and IT infrastructure engagements for three not-for-profit organisations.  
  For each project, prepared independent and group reports, and presented findings to clients and project mentors.  
  1. **SlaveCheck Foundation (Sydney, Australia)** – Performed a non-credentialed web application vulnerability assessment of SlaveCheck’s main service, evaluating certificate configurations and overall HTTP security posture.  
  2. **My1Health (Kenya)** – Conducted infrastructure vulnerability assessments of AWS-hosted cloud servers, identifying external security weaknesses.  
  3. **GRC Assessment and Security Policies (Courtroom5, North Carolina, USA)** – Evaluated the organisation’s cloud-based legal platform architecture, connectivity, and security practices. Assessed governance, risk, and compliance posture, and developed tailored security policy documentation.  
  4. **Incident Response Planning (Courtroom5, North Carolina, USA)** – Conducted incident response planning based on GRC findings and created runbook procedures to support operational resilience and guide technical response actions.  

- **Logitrain IT Internship Certificate of Completion (2023)**  
  My internship with Logitrain enhanced my exposure to Windows Server including Active Directory and Group Policy, Cisco configuration, ITIL practices, and familiarised me with common ticketing system fundamentals.

## Summary:

I'm a cybersecurity and IT support professional with hands-on experience in threat detection, log analysis, secure network design, and technical troubleshooting. I hold CompTIA certifications in Pentest+, CySA+, Security+, Network+, and A+, which reflect my broad capabilities across cybersecurity operations, infrastructure support, and hardware diagnostics.

My skill set includes SOC-level competencies such as alert triage, log correlation, and threat investigation—skills I've honed through continuous hands-on learning and lab-based experimentation. In my homelab, I simulate production-grade infrastructure using pfSense, VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, Qotom mini PC acting as PFsense firewall and Wazuh server and a Cisco 3750G switch. This setup allows me to practically test firewall rules, VLAN segmentation, OS deployments, and backup workflows. I’ve also gained experience configuring Cisco devices through Cisco Packet Tracer and regularly sharpen my skills through platforms like TryHackMe and Pluralsight.

I bring practical IT support experience across hardware and network domains, shaped by my Logitrain internship, CompTIA studies, and extensive homelab experimentation. I've worked with Windows Server, Active Directory, and Cisco networking, building hands-on skills in configuration and troubleshooting through realistic, production-aligned scenarios. My support capabilities include ESD-safe hardware repairs and resolving complex network issues such as DHCP conflicts, DNS failures, firewall misconfigurations, and OS access permission problems.

Academically, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Optoelectronics and an Honours degree in Physics, both focused on telecommunications and electro-optic technologies. I graduated with a High Distinction average and earned an H1 result in my Honours year, which reflects the analytical mindset and structured approach I bring to problem-solving in my technical work.

I'm hybrid-ready and available for onsite support across Melbourne. I value authenticity, efficiency, and practical outcomes—qualities that make me a reliable asset for MSPs, SOC teams, and client-facing IT operations.
