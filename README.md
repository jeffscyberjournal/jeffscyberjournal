Technically skilled and forensic-minded, I'm an IT and cybersecurity professional driven to tackle complex challenges across system administration, threat detection, and exploit analysis.


## Objective

As part of my journey through cybersecurity, this repository serves as a space to showcase recent experiences, technologies I've worked with, and general IT and security-related projects I've explored. Each entry reflects the context and considerations that were important to me at the time—whether it was deepening technical understanding, experimenting with new tools, or tackling challenges that shaped my learning. This collection is both a personal archive and a practical demonstration of growth through hands-on engagement.
